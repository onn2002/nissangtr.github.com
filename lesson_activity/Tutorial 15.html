<p class="a">The BMW M4 is a high-performance version of the BMW 4 Series coupés and convertibles developed by BMW's motorsport division, BMW M, and marketed since 2014.

    As part of the renumbering that splits the 3 Series coupé and convertible models into the 4 Series, the M4 replaced the BMW M3 coupé and convertible models. Upgrades over the standard BMW 4 Series include an upgraded engine, suspension, exhaust system, brakes and weight reduction measures including increased use of carbon fibre, such as on the roof of the car.[1]
    
    First generation (F82/F83; 2014)</p>

    <p class="b">The Nissan GT-R (Gran Turismo–Racing; model code: R35; Japanese: 日産・GT-R; Nissan GT-R) is a 2+2 seater, front mid-engine, all-wheel drive sports car and grand tourer, developed and produced by Nissan. It succeeds the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a high-performance variant of the Nissan Skyline luxury coupe. Although this model was the sixth-generation to bear the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline line-up. The car is built on the PM platform, derived from the FM platform used in the Skyline and Nissan Z models. Production is conducted in a shared production line at Nissan's Tochigi plant in Japan.</p>
