       <font face="Time New Roman" size="5" color="red">Zed (birth name Govos and later given the name Usan) also known as <font size="6" color="white">（劫）</font> The Master of Shadows,<br> is an anti-heroic character
        Adopted by the Kinkou Order's leader Master Kusho,<br>
         Zed trained alongside his master's son Shen.<br>
          After the two were sent to investigate the crimes of serial killer Khada Jhin, <br>
          Zed became disillusioned towards the Kinkou's teachings due to the inhumanity of Jhin's murders<br>
           and the rising tensions between Ionia and Noxus. <br>
           He later disbanded the Kinkou due to his resentment towards Kusho for refusing to stop Jhin and the Noxians, <br>
           and formed the Yanléi Order, commonly known as the Shadow Order.<br>
            While Zed has committed many crimes and betrayed the teachings of his master,<br>
             he will do whatever it takes to see Ionia triumph.<br>

         is a heroic character<br>
        An Ionian swordsman who trained under Elder Souma,<br>
         whom taught him his signature wind technique.<br>
          Yasuo abandoned his duty to protect his master to fight in the war between Ionia and Noxus,<br>
           but Souma was killed by the time he returned. <br>
           Yasuo was accused of being Souma's murderer due to the crime scene resembling a wind technique like his,<br>
            resulting in all of his friends and loved ones turning on him.<br>
             Yasuo had to kill them all out of self-defense,<br>
              including his brother Yone. <br>
              While he eventually had his name cleared and got to meet his resurrected brother, <br>
              he still carries guilt within his heart wherever he goes.</font>

       <font face="Time New Roman" size="5" color="red">A master of Ionia’s ancient martial arts <font size="6" color="white">（李星）</font>,<br>
         Lee Sin is a principled fighter who channels the essence of the dragon spirit to face any challenge. <br>
         Though he lost his sight many years ago, <br>
         the warrior-monk has devoted his life to protecting his homeland against any who would dare upset its sacred balance.<br>
        Enemies who underestimate his meditative demeanor will endure his fabled burning fists and blazing roundhouse kicks.<br>
        Among the many spirits Ionians revere, none are as storied as that of the dragon. <br>
        While some believe it embodies ruin, others view it as a symbol of rebirth.<br> 
        Few can say for certain, and fewer still have ever been able to channel the dragon’s spirit, <br>
        and none so completely as Lee Sin.</font>

       When the cruel wraith Thresh killed Senna and imprisoned her soul, Lucian spent years hunting Thresh down to free Senna's soul from his torture.<br>
       He eventually freed her, but she chose to remain on Runeterra, and the two now fight to rebuild the Sentinels and fight the source of the Black Mist itself, <br>
       the Ruined King.</font>
